Determine optimal cribbage play based on a variety of factors

### Instructions:

So far only the basic classes and a couple counting demos are complete. Eventually, I hope to turn this into a fully-functional terminal-based cribbage game, but for now I'm just working on the foundations and some demos for fun.

#### Setup:
I'm not distributing anything with dependencies yet, but you can install them with a package manager of your choosing or use pip:
    pip3 install colorama pyfiglet

#### Demos:
Hand counting demo
    python3 counting_demo.py

Optimal discard analysis demo (WIP)
    python3 discard_analysis_demo.py
